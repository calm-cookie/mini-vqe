My solution for QIndia's [mini project](https://github.com/qIndia/Techni-Q/blob/main/Project%201.md) on Variational Quantum Eigensolver. The jupyter notebook ```mini-vqe.ipynb``` contains the step-by-step solution.

## Problem Statement
Find the expectation value of the Hamiltonian Z âŠ— Z, with respect to an arbitrarily constructed trial state using a parametrized quantum circuit in Qiskit.
